Their network was recently affected by a suspected ransomware assault. Critical files have been locked, leading to disruptions and concerns over possible data breaches. Initial indicators suggest the attack was carried out by an advanced threat actor. Your role is to examine the available evidence, identify the attackers' techniques, evaluate the breach's scope, and assist in mitigating the threat to restore the network's integrity.",
