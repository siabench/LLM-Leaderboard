        "scenario": "An unsuspecting user browses the web and clicks on a seemingly harmless link, leading them to a compromised web page. Without warning, the page redirects the browser to a malicious PDF file. As the PDF opens in the browsers Adobe Acrobat Reader plug-in, an unpatched vulnerability in the software is silently exploited. The attackers malware is then downloaded and installed onto the users machine, all without their knowledge. The cyber defense team has captured the network traffic during this incident. Your task is to analyze the provided pcap file and extract relevant information to understand the attack.",
