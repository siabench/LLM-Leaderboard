        "scenario": "Multiple users of a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform have reported suspicious fund withdrawals without their consent. An in-depth forensic analysis traced the issue to a phishing website that closely resembled the legitimate PancakeSwap exchange and deceived victims into revealing their wallet seed phrases. The phishing infrastructure was hosted on a hijacked server, with stolen credentials being transmitted through a Telegram bot. Your mission is to carry out threat intelligence analysis of the phishing infrastructure, uncover indicators of compromise (IoCs), and investigate the attackerâ€™s digital activity, including Telegram IDs and online aliases, to better understand their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).",
