This process is running from a temporary directory and has multiple suspicious network connections, including connections to external IP 54.174.131.235 on port 80. The process name contains \"C2\" which could indicate Command and Control functionality, and it has unusual local port bindings. These characteristics suggest this process may be malicious and masquerading as a legitimate Skype updater.",
