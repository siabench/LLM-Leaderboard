The analysis reveals that IP 10.251.96.4 is systematically scanning IP 10.251.96.5, attempting to connect to sequential ports from 1 to 1024. This is a classic pattern of port scanning, where a single source IP is methodically probing multiple ports on a target system. The traffic shows single connection attempts (SYN packets without ACK) to numerous sequential ports, which is a typical characteristic of a port scan.",

This IP address was observed making 1,237 connection attempts (SYN packets without ACK) to IP 10.251.96.5, systematically probing multiple ports, which is consistent with port scanning behavior.",

    "answer_found_by_llm": "The suspicious host (10.251.96.4) scanned ports from 1 to 1024. This range covers the well-known ports, which is a common target range for port scanning activities as it includes most of the standard service ports.",

    "answer_found_by_llm": "The suspicious host conducted a TCP Connect scan (also known as a full connect scan). This is evidenced by the complete TCP three-way handshake pattern observed in the traffic, where we see:\n1. Initial SYN flags (0x0002) for connection initiation\n2. Following ACK flags (0x0010) for connection establishment\n3. PSH+ACK flags (0x0018) for data transmission\n4. FIN+ACK flags (0x0011) for connection termination\nThis pattern indicates that full TCP connections were established with each port, which is characteristic of a TCP Connect scan, as opposed to other types of scans like SYN scans (half-open) or stealth scans that don't complete the full TCP handshake.",

    "answer_found_by_llm": "Yes, there were additional tools used for reconnaissance after the initial port scanning. The primary tool identified was SQLMap (version 1.4.7), which was used for SQL injection testing against web applications running on open ports. This is evidenced by the user agent string \"sqlmap/1.4.7#stable (http://sqlmap.org)\" in the HTTP requests. Additionally, there were attempts to perform command injection reconnaissance through GET requests to \"/uploads/dbfunctions.php\" with parameters like \"?cmd=id\" and \"?cmd=whoami\", suggesting the use of web vulnerability scanning tools or manual reconnaissance techniques targeting PHP applications.",

The attacker first uploaded a web shell (dbfunctions.php) and then used it to execute a Python command that created a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's IP (10.251.96.4) on port 4422. The successful establishment of this reverse shell is confirmed by the subsequent TCP traffic showing sustained bidirectional communication on port 4422 between the compromised host (10.251.96.5) and the attacker's system (10.251.96.4).",
