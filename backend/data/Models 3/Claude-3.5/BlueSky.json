    "answer_found_by_llm": "The attacker enabled the Remote Registry service on the target host. This is evidenced by the presence of Service Control Manager (SCM) operations in the capture file, including SCMOpenSCManagerW, SCMCreateServiceW, and SCMStartServiceW functions, with specific access masks (0x3f,0x00,0x00,0x00) that indicate service manipulation. Enabling the Remote Registry service would allow the attacker to remotely modify registry settings and facilitate further lateral movement within the network.",

This is evidenced by PowerShell code in the capture file that shows specific targeting of LSASS through OpenProcessToken calls, token duplication operations, and privilege escalation attempts using SeDebugPrivilege. The code also shows attempts to create and impersonate LSASS tokens using TOKEN_IMPERSONATE and TOKEN_DUPLICATE permissions.",
